### GeoF: GeoForest clustering experiments

GeoForest is a tiny, reproducible sandbox for geometry-aware clustering built on unsupervised random-forest similarities.

It currently contains two scripts:

- geoforest_subspace.py – main dimension-sweep experiments on synthetic subspace clusters.

- geoforest_sweeps.py – robustness and ablation sweeps (SNR, imbalance, informative dims per cluster, #clusters, stability, axis-aligned vs oblique forests).
